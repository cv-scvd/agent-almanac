/**
 * Fail if `scripts/test/` holds no test files.
 *
 * Wired as npm's `pretest:scripts` hook, so it runs before the suite on every
 * `npm run test:scripts` — including the one step of `.github/workflows/ci-scripts.yml`.
 *
 * Without it that job is a gate that cannot fail. `node --test scripts/test/*.test.js`
 * prints `tests 0 / fail 0` and exits 0 when the glob matches nothing, so renaming,
 * moving into a subdirectory (the glob is single-level), or deleting the suite leaves
 * the check green while running nothing at all. Verified: an empty `scripts/test/`
 * exits 0 under Node 24 and 25, and under `sh`, which passes an unmatched glob through
 * literally for Node's own globber to resolve to zero files.
 *
 * That is the same vacuous green the PR adding this directory (#486) exists to
 * eliminate in the normalizer, so it should not be how the normalizer's own gate
 * behaves. The sibling `test:cli` names its file explicitly and dies loudly instead;
 * this keeps the glob's convenience without inheriting its silence.
 *
 * Deliberately named with a leading underscore: `*.test.js` must not match it, or it
 * would be collected as a test and its failure would read as a test failure.
